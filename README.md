## Spurious 800-53-MP Media and Protection
    Revised and updated this policy which, as outlined in NIST 800-53, focuses on implementing 
    safeguards to prevent unauthorized access, disclosure, and alteration of sensitive 
    information stored on different types of media. This includes considerations for both 
    digital and physical media, such as hard drives, removable storage devices, and paper 
    records. The goal is to ensure the confidentiality and integrity of information 
    throughout its lifecycle, from creation to disposal.
    
    I then lead the effort to get the policy reviewed by the policy committee and get it approved 
    by senior management.  

## Spurious 800-53-SC System and Communications Protection
    Revised and updated this policy which, as outlined in NIST 800-53, addresses a range of security 
    considerations related to networks, data flows, and communication channels within an organization's 
    information systems. It includes controls and guidelines for implementing measures such as boundary 
    protections, network monitoring, secure configurations, and controls to prevent unauthorized access 
    and tampering of information during transmission.
    
    I then lead the effort to get the policy reviewed by the policy committee and get it approved 
    by senior management.  

## Spurious Architectural Decision Record Template 
    An architectural decision record (ADR) is a document that describes a choice the team makes
    about a significant aspect of the software architecture theyâ€™re planning to build. Each 
    ADR describes the architectural decision, its context, and its consequences.

## Spurious CCBCharter
    A Change Control Board (CCB) Charter is a document that outlines the purpose, responsibilities, 
    structure, and processes of a Change Control Board within an organization. The CCB is typically 
    established to manage     and oversee changes to a project, system, or process. The charter 
    serves as a foundational document that defines the CCB's role in maintaining control and 
    ensuring the integrity of the change management process.
    
    I wrote the CCB Charter and then ran the Board for many years. 

## Spurious Emergency Messaging Procedures Guide
    
    The guide was written for senior mamagement to instruct them on how and when to use 
    the emergency messaging system implemented at a company. 

## Spurious Headquarters Building Health and Safety Manual
    A Building Health and Safety Manual is a comprehensive document that outlines policies, 
    procedures, and guidelines to ensure the well-being and safety of individuals within a 
    building or facility. The manual serves as a valuable resource for building occupants, 
    employees, contractors, and visitors, providing essential information on safety measures, 
    emergency procedures, and health-related protocols.
    
    I created this document at the request of senior management on the return to the office 
    after the COVID-19 pandemic and to fulfill an audit requirement.  The senior management 
    was very impressed at the speed of which the document was created and its content. 

## Spurious New Hire Flowchart
    A New Hire Flowchart is a visual representation of the step-by-step process that an 
    organization follows when bringing a new employee onboard. This flowchart provides a clear 
    and structured overview of the various stages and activities involved in the new hire 
    process, from the initial recruitment phase to the employee's integration into the company.
    
    I created this flowchart as part of the project I lead to implement a new ITSM 
    and asset management system. 

## Spurious TRBCharter
    A Technical Review Board (TRB) Charter is a document that outlines the purpose, 
    authority, structure, and processes of a Technical Review Board within an organization. 
    The TRB is typically established to provide oversight and guidance on technical matters, 
    ensuring that projects, systems, or processes align with established technical standards 
    and objectives. The charter serves as a foundational document that defines 
    the TRB's role in technical governance.
    
    I wrote the TRB Charter and then ran the Board for many years. 

## Documentation Example 
    This is an example of documentation I have created for regression tests. It is also the same 
    format I have used for install guides and lab instructions.  It is meant to be used both for 
    educating a new user on the test and to guide the user through the test itself.  The goal 
    of the document is for the new user to read this document and then be able to execute the 
    test with limited if any assistance. 

    The Unemployment Insurance Application depicted is an operational system that is 
    publicly available on the internet.  

    All data and any persons depicted are all fake test data.  Nothing is real.

## List of Publications
    A list of the presentations I have given at various conferences over many years at 
    locations in North America, Europe, Asia, and Australia.   
    

I have also written Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) guides, Installation and Configuration Guides, Requirement Documents, Training Exercises, Test Cases, Architectural Decisions, and many conference and training presentations.
