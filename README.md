## Spurious_800-53-MP_Media_and_Protection.pdf
    Revised and updated this policy which, as outlined in NIST 800-53, focuses on implementing safeguards to prevent 
    unauthorized access, disclosure, and alteration of sensitive information stored on different types of media. 
    This includes considerations for both digital and physical media, such as hard drives, removable storage devices, 
    and paper records. The goal is to ensure the confidentiality and integrity of information throughout its 
    lifecycle, from creation to disposal.
    I then lead the effort to get the policy reviewed by the policy committee and get it approved by senior management.

    includes controls and guidelines for implementing measures such as boundary protections, network monitoring, 
    secure configurations, and controls to prevent unauthorized access and tampering of information during transmission.

## Spurious_CCBCharter.pdf
    A Change Control Board (CCB) Charter is a document that outlines the purpose, responsibilities, structure, 
    and processes of a Change Control Board within an organization. The CCB is typically established to manage 
    and oversee changes to a project, system, or process. The charter serves as a foundational document that

    Wrote the CCB Charter and then ran the Board for many years. 

## Spurious_Headquarters_Building_Health_and_Safety_Manual.pdf
    A Building Health and Safety Manual is a comprehensive document that outlines policies, procedures, and 
    guidelines to ensure the well-being and safety of individuals within a building or facility. The manual serves 
    as a valuable resource for building occupants, employees, contractors, and visitors, providing essential 
    information on safety measures, emergency procedures, and health-related protocols.
    I created this document at the request of senior management on the return to the office after the COVID-19 
    pandemic and to fulfill an audit requirement.  The senior management was very impressed at the speed of 
    which the document was created and its content.
